# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

You can play this game against a computer. But remember, this bot plays the first few moves randomly to learn your play style. As you play, it calculates the possible moves you can play and finds the best move against you.

If you want to win you have to be as random as possible ðŸŽ²

## Running the game

```
npx serve ./
```
You can run this command in the directory where the index.html file is located, or you can easily serve it with the "live server" plugin in the visual studio code.
